# Translating Extension Manager

## How to add new translation

1. You need software to translate Extension Manager. In this example, we will use [POEdit](https://poedit.net/).
2. Clone Extension Manager repository to your device. You can do this using command line. If you have configured git:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:mjakeman/extension-manager.git
```
Or you can click green button `Code`, then click `Download ZIP`, which will download repository inside of zip file.

Unpack it with archive manager.

3. You need pot file, that lies inside `./po` folder. Make sure, that [pot file is up-to-date](#regenerate-pot-files), before proceeding.
4. Open it with POEditor.
5. Click on button `Create a new translation`, select your desired language.
6. Press `Ctrl+S` to save new file, place it inside `./po` folder with filename that POEdit give you.
7. Open `./po/LINGUAS` file with any text editor, and add there locale code of you language. For example, if you want to add Ukrainian translation, POEdit will suggest you filename `uk.po`, so in `LINGUAS` file, you need to add `uk`.

But sometimes you might want to specify variant for your language. For example, for Russian in Russia Federation, you need to set locale to `ru_RU`, instead of just `ru`.

More about locales you can learn [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Locale-Names.html).

9. [Test your translation!](#how-to-test-translation)

## How to test translation

After you finished translation, you might want to test it. The easiest way to do so, is to use GNOME Builder.

1. If you doesn't have [GNOME Builder](apps.gnome.org/Builder), install it.
2. Open it.
3. Click on button below `Select a Folder...` and pick folder with Extension Manager source [that we cloned before](#how-to-add-new translation).
4. In upper-center, click on hammer button to build Extension Manager.
5. Then click on button with `triangle pointing down` in upper-center.
6. In opened menu pick `Install`.
7. Then open `New Runtime Terminal` via `Ctrl+Alt+T` or click `plus button` in top-left corner and pick `New Runtime Terminal`.
8. In opened terminal, you need to force locale that you want to show. Usually, it will match locale name of your `po` file or it might require to specify your regional code. For example, to force application in Ukrainian language, you need to type:
```bash
LC_ALL=uk_UA.UTF-8
```
Where you need to replace `uk_UA` with your desired locale.

9. Run `extension-manager` to run Extension Manager with locale that you want to test.

Once you done some changes, you need to refresh application so it will apply changes to translation. To do so:

1. Stop current running Extension Manager with `Ctrl+C` in terminal or simply close Extension Manager window.
2. Then click on button with `triangle pointing down` in GNOME Builder.
3. In opened menu pick `Install`.

After that, you can again run `extension-manager` in terminal, where your changes to `po` file will be applied to Extension Manager.

## How to update existing translation
If you want update to update translation that someone else already did:

1. Try to contact original translator. You might find their contact info in top of `po` file of translation that you want to update (if you will open it via any text editor) or in `translator-credits` and ask them about changes in translation.
2. If you can't contact them for some reasons or they don't respond, then just translate on your own.
3. [Re-generate pot file](#regenerate-pot-files).
4. Open `po` file that you want to update with POEditor.
5. In top menu click `Translation`, then `Update from POT fileâ€¦`, and pick `pot` file that you re-generated earlier.
6. If you wish, don't forget to add yourself to `translator-credits` and in top of `po` file via text editor.

Try to be consistent with choices that previous translator did, unless they contradict other GTK/GNOME applications translated terms or you think that your translation will be better.

## How to contribute your translation
1. Make sure, that you have account on [Github](https://github.com/). And if not, create one.

2. Also make sure, that you know some basics about how to make pull requests: [How to make pull request from fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) and [How to create fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks).

3. Upload changes that you make in your local copy of repository to your Github fork.

If you already know how to use git, this can be done like this:
```bash
cd extension-manager
git commit -m "I translated Extension Manager!"
git push
```

If not, you could use Github interface to do so:

1. Open your fork on Github, navigate to `./po` folder.
2. Click `Add file` then `Upload files` and pick your translated `po` file and `LINGUAS`.
3. Make sure that everything correct, there no typos in translation, mistakes, you didn't upload wrong files by accident, etc.
4. Open [pull request](https://github.com/mjakeman/extension-manager/compare) to Extension Manager repository against your fork.

## Tips about translating
1. Try to be consistent in your translation with other GTK/GNOME applications.

Pick same terms, use same accelerations, etc.

2. Always check your translation before opening pull request, don't just blindly translate.

3. Open your `po` file with any text editor, not with POEdit, and in top most of file you will find some placeholder info for your translation. Please, fill it, if you can. Take as example `uk.po` file.

4. `translator-credits` is optional and you not comfortable with sharing your alias or email or link, then leave it as-is. Also, if there will be credits for other translators, please, don't remove them. Just add your credit info on newline.

If you want to put email, do this:

`your_alias <somecooladress@mail.com>`

And if you want to place link:

`your_alias https://example.com`

You can check if you input everything correctly in `About` dialog of Extension Manager.

## Regenerate POT files
Before proceeding, make sure that you have `meson` installed on your system. On some Linux distribution, there might be no pre-installed `meson`, so you need to install it manually.

On Fedora, you can install it with:
```bash
sudo dnf install meson
```

If you want to regenerate the `pot` file (i.e. when it hasn't been updated in
a while), there are a few steps that need to be followed:

### Update POTFILES with latest source files
Replace the contents of `POTFILES` with the output of the `print-source-files.sh`
script. Make sure to run it from this directory (`./po`).

Like this: 
```bash
cd extension-manager/po
./print-source-files.sh
```

### Build POT file
Go to the build directory (typically `_build`, but whichever you specified
when running meson).

Like this:

```bash
cd extension-manager
mkdir ./_build
cd ./_build
```

But if you didn't run `meson` on Extension Manager before, you might need to initialize meson in `_build` folder before proceeding.
```bash
meson
```

Now meson is initialized and you can re-generate `pot` file.

Like this:
```bash
meson compile extension-manager-pot
```
